# Interfacing with many PowerMeters and/or SmartMeters at once

SmartMeters and PowerMeters are custom IP based energy monitoring solutions.
See the following repos:
* [PowerMeter](https://github.com/voelkerb/powermeter)
* [SmartMeter](https://github.com/voelkerb/smartmeter)

Use the files in this repo to 
* distribute firmware updates in a fast and easy way.
* interface with the systems (e.g. plot their data).
* change their settings.
